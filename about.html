            <p>You have successfully installed XAMP on this systen! Now yo can start using Apache, MariaDB, PH and other
                components. You can find more info in the FAs section or check the HOW-TO Guides for getting started
                with PHP applications.

                XAMPP is meant only for development purposes. It has certain configuration settings that make it easy to
                develop locally but that are insecure if you want to have your installation accessible to others. If you
                want have your XAMPP accessible from the internet, make sure you understand the implications and you
                checked the FAQs to learn how to protect your site: Alternatively you can use WAMP, MAMP or LAMP which
                are similar packages which are more suitable for production.
